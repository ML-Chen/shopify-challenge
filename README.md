# Shopify Challenge

Backend and data developer challenge for Shopify. This project allows a user to upload images, protected by a certain password, and delete them. Images can be private, in which case only users with the password can view them. Only users using the corresponding password can delete an image.

See the README.md in the /backend repo for more details regarding the backend.

Possible future improvements:

- Use authorization header for password instead of body param
- Hash and salt passwords
