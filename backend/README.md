# Backend

Backend server. This uses:

- TypeScript
- Auth0 for authentication
- Azure Blob Storage for storing images
- and it is deployed in Heroku

Setup:

```
npm install
```

Put necessary environment variables in the `.env` file. See the `.env.example` file for reference.

As a best security practice, the passwords should be salted and hashed, but for simplicity, I did not.

Then run,

```
npm run dev
```

to run in development mode, or â€¦

## Development

### MongoDB Atlas

We're using a MongoDB Atlas database. See https://studio3t.com/knowledge-base/articles/connect-to-mongodb-atlas/ for instructions on how to obtain the connection string.

### Heroku

Heroku is set to auto-deploy the `develop` branch of this repo to [URL pending]. Here's how to set Heroku to deploy from a subfolder: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39197334/automated-heroku-deploy-from-subfolder

If you wanted to create another deployment to Heroku for some reason, here's how you would do it:

Create a Heroku app, and in the Heroku dashboard Deploy tab, set it to deploy from this GitHub repo (or your fork, or whatever).

Under the Heroku dashboard Settings tab, make sure to set additional config vars to match the `.env` file. Add the `heroku/nodejs` buildpack.

Make sure to disable production mode. To do this, create a config var called `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` which is set to `false`. Otherwise, Heroku will not install the dev dependencies properly, and the build will fail. You can set this config var by running the following command in this repo folder, after logging into Heroku CLI:

```sh
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
```
