# Backend

Backend server. This uses:

- TypeScript
- Azure Blob Storage for storing images
- and it is deployed in Heroku

Setup:

```
npm install
```

Put necessary environment variables in the `.env` file. See the `.env.example` file for reference.

Then run,

```
npm run dev
```

to run in development mode, or `npm start` to build and run in production mode.

## Code overview

- `src`
  - `controllers`: defines Express endpoint functions
    - POST /images â€“ multipart/form-data request to upload images
      - user id and password
      - public or private
    - DELETE /images
      - array of image names to be deleted
      - user id and password
    - DELETE /images/all
      - user id and password
  - `models`: Mongoose models
    - `Image.ts`
      - username: string
      - password: string
      - public: boolean
- `test`: integration tests

### Tests

To run tests, start the server, and then run `npm run test`.

## Development

### MongoDB Atlas

We're using a MongoDB Atlas database. See https://studio3t.com/knowledge-base/articles/connect-to-mongodb-atlas/ for instructions on how to obtain the connection string.

### Heroku

Create a Heroku app.

From the root folder, you can push to Heroku (after `heroku login`):

```
git subtree push --prefix backend heroku master
```

Under the Heroku dashboard Settings tab, make sure to set additional config vars to match the `.env` file. (Make sure you don't have single quotes for the environment variable CONNECTION_STRING_AZURE in Heroku.) Add the `heroku/nodejs` buildpack.

Make sure to disable production mode. To do this, create a config var called `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` which is set to `false`. Otherwise, Heroku will not install the dev dependencies properly, and the build will fail. You can set this config var by running the following command in this repo folder, after logging into Heroku CLI:

```sh
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
```

### Azure

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal

- Create an Azure storage account.
- Create a container with public access level set to Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only). I named mine "images".
- To get the connection string, go to "Access keys" under the storage account information. Press "Show keys" and then copy the connection string to .env.
- Set the following environment variables in .env:
  - CONNECTION_STRING_AZURE (you'll need to surround it with single quotes since it has semicolons)
  - STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME_AZURE
  - CONTAINER_NAME_AZURE
